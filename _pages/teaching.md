# Student Projects

My research interests lie in evolutionary computation and multi-objective optimisation, and their applications. Students may choose a project in the areas list below, or propose a project which relates to my research interests.

- Develop randomised algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, local search, novelty search) for combinatorial optimisation problems. This includes classic and emerging problems:
  - TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem);
  - KP (Knapsack Problem);
  - JSSP (Job Shop Scheduling Problem);
  - VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem);
  - Timetabling;
  - Bin Packing;
  - Allocation;
  - NK-Landscape;
  - Quadratic Assignment Problem;
  - …

- Their multi-objective version. Research projects include:
  - To design effective algorithms for a specific multi-objective combinatorial problem.
  - To investigate what kind of search algorithms perform well for a specific multi-objective combinatorial problem.
  - To investigate how well evolutionary algorithms scale up in one type of combinatorial problem.
  - To investigate the search operators (e.g., crossover and mutation) in one type of combinatorial problem and how well they scale up.

- Data visualisation in multi-objective optimisation. When the number of objectives to be optimised is larger than 3, it is not straightforward to observe the results. Therefore, it is important to develop effective methods/tools to help visualise the results. Related projects include:
  - Reducing the dimensionality according to correlation between objectives.
  - Modifying visualisation tools (e.g. parallel coordinates) for clearer observation.

- Multi-criterion decision making. Multi-criteria decision making is a decision making process that involves multiple conflicting criteria/objectives. It is ubiquitous in our daily life (e.g., when purchasing a car, cost, comfort, safety, and fuel economy may be some of the main criteria we consider – it is unusual that the cheapest car is the most comfortable and the safest one). Related projects include:
  - How to select a few representative solutions for better decision making.
  - How to make the results clearer for observation and decision making in high-dimensional space.
  - Comparison between different decision making approaches and their relevance to multi-objective optimisation.

- Comparison between randomised search techniques and MIP (mixed integer programming) like CPLEX and Gurobi on a variety of problem scenarios.

- Evolution in art. Use population-based search algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms) to discover novel/unexpected patterns and designs, for example, to generate novel tree patterns and Chinese-style patterns.
