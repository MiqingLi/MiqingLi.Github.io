I am an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, UK. My research sits at the intersection between AI and optimisation, where I am interested in developing computational intelligence techniques (e.g., evolutionary algorithms) to solve both fundamental and practical optimisation problems. My current research interests include:

- Multi-objective combinatorial optimisation (EAs, local search, NCO).

- Expensive and robust optimisation (EAs, Bayesian).

- General multi-objective optimisation issues (e.g. fitness landscape analysis and visualisation, archiving, performance assessment).

- Many-objective optimisation (algorithm design, visualisation, assisted decision-making).

- Practical applications (e.g. in software engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering).
